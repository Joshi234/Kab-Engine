# Kab-Engine
An experimental 2D game engine in c# based on monogame
If you have any suggestions for the engine, hit me up under discord Joshi234#0203

#How to use?
To get started download the project and delete all the stuff in the functions from the GameCode.cs, since it contains test stuff right now. Use this file to see how the engine works.
You need tp use the mcgb editor to add your assets and load them in.

#Roadmap
